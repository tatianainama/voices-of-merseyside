## Voices of Merseyside

[Voices of Merseyside](voicesofmerseyside.org) is a research project that explores the accents, dialects, and identities of people in Merseyside.

Residents of Merseyside were asked to draw a digital map of where they believe different accents in Merseyside can be found. Then, residents will were asked to provide information about these accents which will allow the researcher to monitor language attitudes.

Voices of Merseyside is an MA thesis project created by [Tanya Parry](mailto:voicesofmerseyside@gmail.com), a fellow Merseysider now living in Amsterdam.

### Technologies used

The project consisted of two applications: a multiplatform survey and an admin panel for the researcher to analyze and read the results.

Both of the applications were bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

The map tool was created using a canvas with the help of [PaperJS](http://paperjs.org/).
